# Do you like Pokemon?
## A small React app for kids (spanish only, for now...) 

## Just print & cut your favorite Pokemons!
This is only a demo using PokeAPI, an excellent source of Pokemon info.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

You can run this project as follows:

## First, clone & run npm install

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### This project was made with React. Only Axios library was used (maybe a little overkill), and I used CSS-Modules as its now included on this version of Create React App



### `Thank you in advance and hope you will enjoy it, as simple it is!!`
